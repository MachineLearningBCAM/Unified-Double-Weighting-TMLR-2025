This repository is the official implementation of [A Unified View of Double-Weighting for Marginal Distribution Shift]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08637](https://openreview.net/forum?id=aPyJilTiIb)). 

The algorithms proposed in the paper provides efficient learning for the proposed Doble-Weighting for Marginal Distribution Shift. In particular, we present algorithms for multi-source covariate shift adaptation and single-source and multi-source label shift adaptation.
